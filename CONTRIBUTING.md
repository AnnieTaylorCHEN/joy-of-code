## How to Contribute

Hey, thanks for your time! If you're contributing for the first time, don't be intimidated. You can't do anything wrong, and things aren't going to explode (I hope).

- I only accept contributions to posts
- At the end of each post, there's a direct link to the markdown file you can edit inside GitHub
- When you're done, submit the pull request
- Please use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format for your commit messages (e.g. "chore: Fix typo")

I have a resource on [using Conventinal Commits](https://joyofcode.xyz/rethink-how-you-write-git-commits), if you need help.
