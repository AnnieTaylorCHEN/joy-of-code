# Web Development Podcasts

How to stay up to date with web development? One of the great methods is listening to podcasts. Take a walk outside, put some earbuds in, and let yourself be entertained while you learn in the process.

## What You'll Gain

- Staying up to date with web development trends
- How to learn
- Specific web development topics you might be interested in
- What's hot, and what you might want to learn based on how often you hear about it
- Soft skills (people's abilities to communicate with each other and work well together)
- Insight from people in the industry
- Building resumes, and portfolios, hiring

Without further ado, this is my list in alphabetical order. Keep in mind that most of these are skewed towards JavaScript, since that's my main area of interest.

## 1. Chats with Kent

[Chats with Kent](https://kentcdodds.com/chats-with-kent-podcast/) is hosted by [@kentcdodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds) who might be the politest, empathetic, and helpful person I've listened to. His area of expertise include React, and testing JavaScript as the author of [Testing JavaScript](https://testingjavascript.com/), and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).

You won't hear much about those topics here though, as the main focus are chats, and insights from the guests on the podcast with topics ranging from [Growing Your Skills And Career Through Teaching With Ali Spittel](https://kentcdodds.com/chats-with-kent-podcast/seasons/01/episodes/growing-your-skills-and-career-through-teaching-with-ali-spittel) to [Make Your Apps Resilient Using Finite State Machines With David Khourshid](https://kentcdodds.com/chats-with-kent-podcast/seasons/01/episodes/make-your-apps-resilient-finite-state-machines-with-david-khourshid).

## 2. CodePen Radio

[CodePen Radio](https://blog.codepen.io/radio/) is fascinating with a large list of episodes that are focused on "All about what it's like running a small web software business. The good, the bad, and the ugly" that are not just focused around [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) and running a business, but other aspects of web development.

The cast is always changing, but one of the notable consistent hosts is [@chriscoyier](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier) the co-founder of CodePen, and [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/).

## 3. Full Stack Radio

[Full Stack Radio](https://fullstackradio.com/) is hosted by [@adamwathan](https://twitter.com/adamwathan) who is the creator of the popular [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) framework.

The show focuses on interesting topics such as [Lessons Learned Building Tailwind UI](https://fullstackradio.com/135), and interviews such as [Rich Harris - Svelte and Defending the Modern Web](https://fullstackradio.com/143).

## 4. Ladybug Podcast

We need different voices in tech. That's why [Ladybug Podcast](https://www.ladybug.dev/) stands out having a cast of smart, and witty women with different areas of expertise, and opinions. The cast includes [@ASpittel](https://twitter.com/ASpittel), [@EmmaBostian](https://twitter.com/EmmaBostian), [@kvlly](https://twitter.com/kvlly), and [@shidonichan](https://twitter.com/shidonichan).

## 5. React Podcast

[React Podcast](https://spec.fm/podcasts/reactpodcast) is hosted by [@chantastic](https://twitter.com/chantastic), but despite the name it's more than just [React](https://reactjs.org/). The interviews are always interesting, and worth listening to such as [Maggie Appleton on the Power of Mental Models](https://spec.fm/podcasts/reactpodcast/68306578) where they discuss the artwork behind her [visual explanations of technology, anthropology, and programming](https://maggieappleton.com/).

## 6. Remotely Interesting

[Remotely Interesting](https://open.spotify.com/show/3EM9APeoSjJe4yfIaVfCVO) is a podcast from the team at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) including personalities such as [@sarah_edo](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo) and [@jlengstorf](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf), but also [@cassidoo](https://twitter.com/cassidoo), [@philhawksworth](https://twitter.com/philhawksworth), [@shortdiv](https://twitter.com/shortdiv), and [@Tzmanics](https://twitter.com/tzmanics) in which they dive into the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/), and other web development topics, including recipes.

## 8. Syntax

  alt="Syntax"

I don't have to say much about [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/), the most popular web development podcast. [@wesbos](https://twitter.com/wesbos), and [@stolinski](https://twitter.com/stolinski) are seasoned fullstack developers, and the content they produce is one of the most entertaining while being educational.

You won't just learn about web development, soft skills, and BBQ tips, but also [How Would We Script a PS5 Buying Bot?](https://syntax.fm/show/311/hasty-treat-how-would-we-script-a-ps5-buying-bot) among other things.

## 9. The CSS Podcast

  alt="The CSS Podcast"
  inline

I feel these days there's a gap in HTML/CSS focused content. Luckily, [The CSS Podcast](https://thecsspodcast.libsyn.com/) is here. [@argyleink](https://twitter.com/argyleink), and [@Una](https://twitter.com/Una) are incredible at explaining visual concepts in audio form. You're going to learn a lot, from the fundamentals of CSS to experimental features such as [CSS Houdini](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Houdini).

## 10. The Undefined Podcast

  alt="The Undefined Podcast"
  inline

[The Undefined Podcast](https://undefined.fm/) is a podcast hosted by [@jaredpalmer](https://twitter.com/jaredpalmer), and [@ken_wheeler](https://twitter.com/ken_wheeler) that's unapologetic about it's language, and features a wide variety of guests such as [Vue vs. Svelte with Evan You and Rich Harris](https://undefined.fm/radio/vue-vs-svelte-with-evan-you-and-rich-harris). **Consider this a not safe for work warning**.
