## Misconception About Design

The greatest misconception about design is that you have to be **artistic** because the purpose of design is to solve problems meaning it's [utilitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism). This is why design and development have more in common than you think.

You already know what great design is when you look at it. You just don't know how to talk about it because you lack the required vocabulary to reason what makes a great and bad design.

I'm not going to bore you with theory but give you actual tips you can immediately use and see a drastic improvement in your existing design. I'm not a professional designer but this is what I learned through experience and learning from others.

## The Four Principles of Design

The goal of design is to make things **easy to understand** in a **aesthetically pleasing** way.

**Design is C.R.A.P.** which stands for **contrast**, **repetition**, **alignment** and **proximity**. Remember this [mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic) and always ask yourself if your design meets **C.R.A.P.** standards. A lot of design principles are based from psychology such as the [gestalt principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_grouping) that describe how humans group similar elements and recognize patterns. These are the four principles behind great design.

## Contrast

Contrast draws **attention**.

We can achieve **contrast** in many ways through **color** and **size** of text and shapes to make elements look different. **Contrast** creates **visual hierarchy**, so you know what is important on the page. This means your eyes know in what order to read information without thinking about it.

  alt="Text contrast"
/>

Another example are geometric shapes in design that might seem random but aren't because everything in design has a purpose. Their main purpose is to **draw your eyes** to something while adding **visual interest** or **balance** to an area that would otherwise feel empty.

We can use **color** to increase or reduce contrast for text that's not important because it makes other text **pop** in comparison. For example using a shade of gray on a white background but the mistake you can make is trying to do the same on a **colored** background when you're trying to **de-emphasize** text. In that case you should pick the same background color and adjust the **contrast**.

<Image
  width={640}
  height={555}
  src="/images/design-for-developers/color-contrast-bad.webp"
  alt="Bad text contrast"
/>

Contrast between text and background colors is just as important. Your contrast has to pass [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). There are three levels of conformance from **A**, **AA** to **AAA**.

<Image

  height={555}
  src="/images/design-for-developers/color-contrast-good.webp"
  alt="Good text contrast"
/>

You can check the contrast ratio from your developer tools.

## Repetition

Repetition creates **consistency** in your design.

Repetition helps create **ryhthm** menaing the user can easily recognize and scan the content. Use a **consistent** style for your elements. Repeating the same **font type**, **size** and **color** helps make the content more readable.

Have you ever seen a landing page with a graphic of a mouse indicating there's more to scroll? It always felt to me like the site is treating you as an idiot. Imagine if an artist left clues on a painting explaining it to you.

<Image
  width={640}
  height={490}
  src="/images/design-for-developers/scroll-more-idiot.webp"
  alt="Mouse indicating scrolling"
/>

What I'm trying to say is that we be more clever and use design and **repetition** instead. Lets pretend we're using the line from the logo to establish **repetition**. If you look closely none of the elements are placed randomly but with purpose. We're going to talk more about this in **alignment**.

<Image
  width={640}
  height={490}
  src="/images/design-for-developers/repetition-scrolling-heading.webp"
  alt="Using a design element to indicate scrolling"
/>

If we extend the line to the second page it would indicate to our reader there's more and make your reader curious. The number is mostly a design element and doesn't have to have meaning.

<Image
  width={640}
  height={916}
  src="/images/design-for-developers/repetition-scrolling-area.webp"
  alt="Using a design element to indicate scrolling"
/>

The more you look at design the more you're going to pick up on these details.

## Alignment

Alignment is used to **organize information** creating order.

Design decisions should be **intentional** and not arbitrary. When elements are aligned they visually connect to each other and serve as an **anchor** for the eyes through an invisible line created from using strong alignnment.

It's never one good or bad thing that makes or breaks a design but a lot of other smaller things.

A often **mistake** you can make is to **center** everything and not have a constraint on the width of your text making reading it hard.

<Image
  width={960}
  height={712}
  src="/images/design-for-developers/alignment-bad.webp"
  alt="Bad alignment"
/>

Look at the difference after we just use aligned the content to the left.

<Image
  width={960}
  height={712}
  src="/images/design-for-developers/alignment-good.webp"
  alt="Good alignment"
/>

If you're using a design tool like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) you can enable the grid. I'm using a **twelve column grid** since that's the most frequently used one. You can create the same grid using [CSS grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) for your site making translating your design easy.

Let me show you the invisible line I mentioned earlier.

<Image
  width={960}
  height={712}
  src="/images/design-for-developers/alignment-grid.webp"
  alt="Alignment grid overlay"
/>

You should always have a strong **horizontal** or **vertical** line because it anchors the eye. The **alignment** for the logo and navigation is also **intentional** being on the **baseline**.

This **isn't** to say that centering is bad. You can center short text but when it gets long it becomes hard to read. We're going to cover more on **typography** later.

Once you learn design fundamentals you understand how to break rules to create more interesting design. For example having everything on a grid feels rigid and boring, so a popular trend over the years is having images go outside the grid. You barely notice this but it feels more interesting and looks great because it's **intentional** and that's why design we perceive as **bad** often looks **unintentional**.

Lets look at the design of [Apple.com](https://www.apple.com/) to see how they "break the rules" of the grid in an interesting way to show more products by breaking the grid. The rest of the design is on a grid and aligned perfectly, so it looks **intentional** and not like a mistake because it's **consistent**.

  alt="Apple.com grid overlay"
/>

## Proximity

Proximity is **grouping related things together**.

Take an example where the items are spaced **evenly** and where it's done using **proximity**.

<Image
  width={628}
  height={542}
  src="/images/design-for-developers/proximity.webp"
  alt="Proximity"
/>

Proximity lets you brain group related information together, so it appears as **one visual unit** instead of feeling **unrelated**.

<Image
  width={628}
  height={542}
  src="/images/design-for-developers/proximity-outline.webp"
  alt="Outline around elements showing proximity"
/>

## Layout

Before you do typography or colors use **a piece of paper** or your design tool to draw **wireframes** that are just simple boxes that represent your layout. You're going to avoid a lot of problems before you even get started.

<Image
  width={446}
  height={473}
  src="/images/design-for-developers/wireframe.webp"
  alt="Wireframe"
/>

Just because you're drawing boxes doesn't mean your final design should resemble it meaning using a lot of borders to separate content. Use **contrast** instead to separate content.

Layout is not something that can be taught but it has to be practiced. If you want to create unique designs you have to look at inspiration on sites such as [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/), [Behance](https://www.behance.net/) , [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) or [Lapa](https://www.lapa.ninja/) and learn from recreating the designs. Expose yourself to great design by using a new tab extension for your browser like [Panda](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/panda-5-your-favorite-web/haafibkemckmbknhfkiiniobjpgkebko).

Using a grid is going to make you realize how everything in design is **intentional**. This isn't always the case because a lot of great looking design isn't always professional design, so you're going to notice a difference between amateur and professional design.

Here is how you could be more creative with your designs. Pretend this is a landing page with a form. The first idea is boring but then you can play with the design by adding **visual interest**. You can do as many layout ideas as you want.

<Image
  width={905}
  height={504}
  src="/images/design-for-developers/wireframe-landing-page.webp"
  alt="Landing page wireframe"
/>

Don't try to make it look good but just try out random ideas. This takes less than a minute and doesn't have you commit to anything. Figure out the content first before you start designing.

## Spacing

For the spacing of your elements use the same scale as we made for the typography. Use the four principles of design together to create a cohesive looking design.

## Typography

<Image

  alt="Typefaces"
/>

Typography is important because it envokes emotion. **Serif** fonts looks elegant and associate wealth and luxury or remind you of the newspaper and books while **sans-serif** fonts look more modern and legible for large text and screens, so they're used everywhere.

Having great looking typography isn't hard with a couple of rules:

- Use a single **sans-serif** font and **weights** for contrast
- Anything below **16 pixels** and **400** for the font weight is not readable
- Skip a font weight for more **contrast** (**400, 600, 700, 900**)
- Use a **line height** between **150-180%** for text
- Don't forget to adjust the **line height** for titles
- Avoid using **absolute** color values like pure black and white as it's harsh on the eyes, so use a **shade** instead
- Add a subtle color to text to make it feel **cooler** or **warmer**
- Use one of these [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): **Inter**, **Lato**, **Montserrat**, **Open Sans**, **Poppins**, **Raleway**, **Roboto**

If the list is long go for **Inter** for a more professional font and **Montserrat** or **Poppins** for something more playful.

For the typography scale you don't need to use a [Fibonnaci number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) generator to get some divine ratio for a **cohesive** looking design. I prefer to use **multiples of eight** meaning **8px**, **16px**, **24px**, **32px**, **64px** and so on because it works so great as a base unit for typography and spacing inside a **8 point grid** system. If you're using a design tool such as **Figma** set your nudge value to **8px** to use a **8 point grid**.

You can take those same values and create [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) for your typography and spacing.

Even if I say "rules" don't take any of it as **gospel** but just constraints to help you create a **consistent** design and avoid mindless **pixel pushing**. The optimal reading length for text is around **60 characters** but I prefer to go up to **80 characters**. You can set the `max-width` of your content to `60ch` in your **CSS**. One of the most important things for legible text is **line height**. I find a great **line height** to be from **150%** to **180%** or **1.5** to **1.8** in **CSS**.

You should always test how your typography looks on real text, so try using real text instead of **lorem ipsum**. Don't forget to adjust your title's **line height** also to compensate.

## Color

<Image

  alt="Color wheel"
/>

Most color picking sites aren't helpful because they give you five random colors you have no idea what to do with. You only need to find **primary** color you like and from there we can find **complementary** colors that work with it. if you're using **black** and **white** you're already using two colors.

You can use **shades** of one color for a **monochromatic** color scheme, so you don't even need more colors.

To find a **complementary** color is simple — just pick the color opposite the **primary** color you picked on the **color wheel**.

<Image
  width={500}
  height={400}
  src="/images/design-for-developers/color-picker.webp"
  alt="Color picker"
/>

I like the [color picker from Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/) because it's simple and you can learn more about color.

You can use the **60-30-10** color rule taken from interior design where **60%** is the **main** color, **30%** is the **secondary** color and **10%** is your **accent** color. It also doesn't mean your **primary** color should always take up **60%** because you can flip the values for different sections of your site.

<Image
  width={464}
  height={272}
  src="/images/design-for-developers/color-palette.webp"
  alt="Color palette"
/>

Because the green is so high contrast it wouldn't work for the text, so we're using the green as the accent color.

<Image
  width={960}
  height={712}
  src="/images/design-for-developers/color-rule.webp"
  alt="Color rule"
/>

The purple is taking up **60%** of the space and the white is taking up **30%** while the accent color is taking up **10%**, so treat these values more as ratios.

## Conclusion

You learned enough visual design to be dangerous as a developer. If you stick to a couple of simple rules you can be confident your design is going to look great. You have the vocabulary to critique and talk about design in a more intelligent way.

If this ignited your passion for design I highly recommend reading [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com/book) and [Design for Hackers: Reverse Engineering Beauty](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Hackers-Reverse-Engineering-Beauty/dp/1119998956).
