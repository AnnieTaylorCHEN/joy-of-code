# Automate Image Optimization

## Image Optimization is a Pain

If you're using images anywhere hosting is only part of the equation since you have to make sure they're optimized for your users.

There's just one problem ‚Äî **it's a giant pain**.

## Squoosh

[Squoosh](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh) is a project by Google that optimizes your images right in the browser.

<Image
  height="778px"
  width="1177px"
  src="/images/how-to-optimize-images/squoosh.webp"
  alt="Squoosh"
/>

The [Squoosh app](https://squoosh.app/) has a delightful user interface. The only downside is that it takes a couple of steps for every image which can get tedious.

## Using the Squoosh CLI

Thankfully we can use the [Squoosh CLI](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh/tree/dev/cli) (command-line interface) to automate it.

You can invoke the `@squoosh/cli` using the `npx` command which just downloads the binary in `node_modules` meaning a global install is not required.

```shell:terminal
npx @squoosh/cli -h
```

This is going to show us the options.

```shell:terminal
Usage: squoosh-cli [options] <files...>

Options:
  -V, --version                                          output the version number
  -d, --output-dir <dir>                                 Output directory (default: ".")
  -s, --suffix <suffix>                                  Append suffix to output files (default: "")
  --max-optimizer-rounds <rounds>                        Maximum number of compressions to use for auto optimizations (default: "6")
  --optimizer-butteraugli-target <butteraugli distance>  Target Butteraugli distance for auto optimizer (default: "1.4")
  --resize [config]                                      Resize the image before compressing
  --quant [config]                                       Reduce the number of colors used (aka. paletting)
  --rotate [config]                                      Rotate image
  --mozjpeg [config]                                     Use MozJPEG to generate a .jpg file with the given configuration
  --webp [config]                                        Use WebP to generate a .webp file with the given configuration
  --avif [config]                                        Use AVIF to generate a .avif file with the given configuration
  --jxl [config]                                         Use JPEG-XL to generate a .jxl file with the given configuration
  --wp2 [config]                                         Use WebP2 to generate a .wp2 file with the given configuration
  --oxipng [config]                                      Use OxiPNG to generate a .png file with the given configuration
  -h, --help                                             display help for command
```

The only problem is that after this the documentation isn't clear and provides no examples.

The only clue they leave you with are the [config options](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh/blob/dev/libsquoosh/src/codecs.ts) for the image format you want but I managed to figure it out after some investigation.

Let's say you want to optimize a bunch of images into the **\*.webp** format.

```shell:terminal
npx @squoosh/cli --webp '{ quality: 100, lossless: 1 }' -d output *
```

You have to pass it the **image format** flag `--webp` then give it a **string of options** and specify the **output** with the `-d` flag followed by the **name of the output folder** and lastly specify the **files** where `*` means everything.

After you run it you should see an output in your **terminal**, so you know it worked.

## Conclusion

**Image optimization** is important and sometimes we're lucky enough that frameworks do the job for us but in most cases that's not the case, or we want to have complete control over it.
